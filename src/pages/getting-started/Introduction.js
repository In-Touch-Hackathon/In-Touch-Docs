## Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is a cloud-based communication API for SMS, Voice and Messaging Apps. In Touch uses [Twilioâ€™s 
Voice API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice) to create a seamless integration with a real phone number.

A Twilio account and phone number is required to get In Touch working. Check [Twilio Setup](/getting-started/twilio) for more information
